# card-collector-authority

TECHNOLOGIES USED

Ternaries were used to designate specific classes to show whether a card was valuable (>$100), was a player's rookie card, or the quantity in stock was running low. Modal was used to make sure user doesn't delete accidentally. 

Bootstrap was used for navbar and containers, with additional CSS used to make website unique.


APPROACH TAKEN

Using the 7 RESTful routes, I created a project that organizes a users sport card collection. In the future, sockets and plugins will be used to let the user build their own collection.
